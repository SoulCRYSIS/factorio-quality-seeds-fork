  "description": "This mod gives you a reason to have high quality seeds. \nAdds a custom Greenhouse cultivator for every plant (Wood, Yumako, and Jellystem + will affect other modded plants!) \nPlants that release spores will release twice as many spores, via a new spores fluid. \nSpores can be released back into the atmosphere at a controlled location by destroying their containing entity, or using a Spore Vent.\nFinally, there is now also the end-game treat of plants in space!",
